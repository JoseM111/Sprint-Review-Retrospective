# Sprint-Review-Retrospective
### A repository displaying agile development

* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
<br>By creating user stories, it provides the scrum team a template to guide them in providing the best user experience and meeting the requirements of each sprint.

* How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
<br>I need to look at the project as a system first than apply maybe the SAFe agile approach to acomplish that with.

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
<br>To be able to communicate your grips, concerns and give each other positive criticism.
